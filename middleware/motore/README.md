# Sentinel in Motore

Implement [Sentinel](https://github.com/sentinel-group/sentinel-rust) as a service in [Motore](https://github.com/cloudwego/motore). 

In the `example` directory, we provide an example for [Volo](https://github.com/cloudwego/volo). 

**Attention: Since TAIT feature is not stablized, you have to use the nightly rustc to compile this example.**
